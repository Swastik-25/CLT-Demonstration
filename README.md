# CLT-Demonstration

This repository contains demonstration of **Central Limit Theorem** using Python. I have conducted the simulations of different probability distributions and noted down my observations on same. An unique animation of the CLT is also covered as part of this. This provides a much better picture and clarity about the concept.
